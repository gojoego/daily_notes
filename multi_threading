Create at least 3 classes that extend Thread and each must do something a little different - then show how to start these threads from another class

Create at least 3 classes that implment Runnable - demonstrate the two ways we can start a Runnable (one in the constructor, and one not in the constructor) - then show how to start these Runnable threads from another class

extending Thread hints:
public MyNewThread(String name){
    super(name);
    start();
}
implementing Runnable hints:
public MyNewRunnable(String name){
    thrd = new Thread(this, name);
    thrd.start();
}
andâ€¦ (how do we use this Runnable?)
public class MySecondRunnable implements Runnable {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("I'm in MySecondRunnable");
    }
}
