methods

1) What makes up a method signature?

	-method signature part of method declaration
	-combination of method name and parameter list 
	-overloading: ability to write methods that have same name but accept different parameters
	-Java compiler able to discern difference between methods and method signatures
	-every object belongs to a class, class declares methods for objects 

2) Write a method signature that takes 2 ints as parameters and returns a double.

	public statis double divide(int a, int b)

3) When does a method stop executing?

	Once the "return" key word is encountered or all the code in method body has executed 

4) How can you return a string from a method? 

	set return to string

5) What is the return type of a method that does not return any value?

	void

6) When a method returns a value, what needs to be done with that value? 

	needs to be set to a declared variable

7) What is method overloading?

	multiple methods with same signature (access modifier, static/nonstatic, return type) but differing parameters 

8) What is the keyword we use to immediately exit a method and return to the calling method?

	return

9) Demonstrate overloading with 3 methods.

	public static double sum(int a, int b){return a + b;} 
	public static double sum(double a, double b){return a + b;} 
	public static double sum(int a, int b, int c){return a + b + c;}
