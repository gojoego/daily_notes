forms
-by default, try to submit via URL 
-you'll see question mark followed by submission 
-.preventDefault 
	-does not refresh page
	-does not submit via URL 


asynchronous programming
callbacks
request pass function to request 
when info comes back 

ajax

asynchronous javascript 
creating request to send http req via url and get data back 	

request object: XMLHttpRequest
to open connection and instantiate requests with new keyword 
append URL and use to get info 
-can monitor many different stages 

.onreadystatechange
pass callback for what we want to do with info when it comes back 
various ready states
fourth done

making web request
what happens after request 
java runs async- other stuff isn't blocked 
event handler 

callback hell
-callback pass functions 

promises 
-prevent callback hell
-come with ability to resolve and reject and handle callback functions in different way 
-use Fetch 
-will send url request 
-event chaining with .then (in Java called method chaining )
-methods chained together
-url in fetch
-fetch returns promise 
-can monitor when done then use functions to create thigns on page 	
- contains the http request 
-header, content type 
-fetch returns promise 
-ability to resolve or reject depending on status that comes back 
-comes in the form of an object
-can extract data from body in  this object 
-cannot access data until turning promise into json 
-arrow function returns implicitly 

similar to what happens in stream apis 

automatic invocation of function 

(function exampleFunction(){})();
surround with parentheses
follow with another set of empty parentheses 
semicolon for good practice 

when browser gets response, converts data to object of type json from text
passes object and logs data
