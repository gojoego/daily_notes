Spring Security 

@Controller: mvc, returns views html not json 

MVC and rest controllers can be used side by side 


if I am trying to replicate the mutts_app database from my local machine
create a database
create a mapper with SQL queries performing the desired task 

add spring security 
every page will need authentication, will need to "link" to database 
two roles
user 
admin 
mapper for this?
