Pro Tip:	when using JPA, it is best not to use underscores 
			use camel case instead 

SQL

-primary key: unique identifier in a table
-foreign key: keys that originate from a different table 

RDBMS: Relational Database Management System 

-data organized into tables or relations 
-row called record or tuple
-column called field or attribute 

Primary database design objectives
	-eliminate data redundancy
		-same piece of data shall not be stored in more than 1 place 
		-duplicate data is wasteful of storage and leads to 
		inconsistencies 
	-ensure data integrity and accuracy 
	-provide access with information an end user needs to join tables together 

working on: 

getting main chat to update when side chats are clicked on 
(updating picture, name, and chats between users)
-when clicking on a sidechat, should pull from message and user table for
	-message.message
	-user.firstName
	-user.lastName
	-user.photoUrl

chats are coming through but they are not designated by sender and recipient 
-Console check: all the messages associated with the specific chat ID are coming through

Debugging User Chats
-issue: all chats are populating as an "in" bubble that indicates
		a chat is from a sender that isn't you 
-NOTES:
	-javascript code written so that if senderId = userId then it will be
	assigned an "out" bubble which indicates that it came from you 
	-all messages coming "in" meaning that all message senders do not 
	match the userId 
	-because the senderId is still coming in as 0


What do I feel that I don't know with this integration project? 
-not 100% about the controller, service, repository/mapper classes
-

send new message
create new messages with new people
