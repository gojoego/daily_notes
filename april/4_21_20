Goals for Today: 

1. create a working registration page for mutts_app
2. debug senderId for specific chats
3. work on SQL queries 

Pro Tips:

1.  POJOs do not have to map or match exactly to their corresponding
	SQL tables in a database 
2.	Break points for debugging: best practice to place it on the 
	first line of executable code 
3.	Store MySQL passwords in keychain (for Mac users)
4. 	Switch databases in MySQL by double clicking on database you 	
	want to work with 
5. 	Refresh MySQL schemes before working on it
