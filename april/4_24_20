Current problem: 

I started working on and did not finish the feature to create a new conservation within MuttsApp. Now none of the sidebar chats and corresponding profile information is populating. 


studying previous problem and debugging:

user chats were not populating at all 

pro tip: get rid of console logs you're not using 

fetch is working and querying the database 

getting the expected call and response 

controllers talk to services
services talk to mappers 

SQL queries

code reviews 

how I would use my non traditional background

API 
application programming interface


new messages are being added to the database but they are not appearing when do an api call to the chats url 

also not appearing in the primary chat window 

something wrong with API endpoint in controller where it isn't pulling new data (at least start with the controller)

could also something wrong with the javascript but starting with the controller first
